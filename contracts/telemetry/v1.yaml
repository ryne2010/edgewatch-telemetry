# EdgeWatch Telemetry Contract (v1)
#
# This is a *lightweight* data contract for metric keys and expected types.
#
# Notes:
# - Unknown keys are allowed by default (additive drift).
# - Known keys must match the declared type (breaking drift is rejected).
# - Use this file to align ingest payloads, UI charts, and downstream processing.
