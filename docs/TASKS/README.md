# Task specs

This folder contains **Codex-ready** specs for larger changes.

Each spec should include:
- intent and non-goals
- acceptance criteria
- design notes (boundaries, data model changes)
- validation plan (harness commands)

When a task changes contracts or boundaries, also write an ADR in `docs/DECISIONS/`.
